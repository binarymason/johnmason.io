    <p>Writing is a big deal.  It is a conduit to creating opinions that you or I may not have known that we had before.  It also puts your opinions out in the wild for the world to see.  While the fear of saying stupid things is real (and will most likely happen), I'd like to start what so many others have before me – a blog.</p>

<p>Writing technical solutions is great… but they will rarely be posted here.  There are plenty of smarter people in the world writing up tutorials on how to do things. Additionally, I don't want to look back to a bunch of out-of-date content.</p>

<p>This blog is for me as much as it is for you.  The goal of this is to encourage different ways of thinking.  If my writing encourages us to walk away with different thought processes or ideas about something, this has been a huge success.</p>

<p>So cheers!</p>
