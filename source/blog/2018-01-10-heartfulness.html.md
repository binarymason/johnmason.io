In Chinese, the word for mind is the same word for heart.  So, "mindfulness" in Chinese could either mean "having the mind in the present" or it could mean "having the heart in the present".

Ironically, mindfulness involves less thinking and more being.

Therefore, I think "heartfulness" is the word we're looking for when we describe being fully present in the moment.
