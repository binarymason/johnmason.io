In his book, _Winning Every Day_, Notre Dame football coach explains how he taught his players to ask themselves the question: "What's important now?" (hence the acryonym).

If his players are focused on what's important _right now_ then they are "winning". Conversely, losing was defined as literally _losing focus_ on what's important.

What's important now?
