Tim Urban gave a [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator) where he jokingly suggests that we all have an instant gratification monkey in our minds.  This monkey likes to lead us to what Tim coined as the "dark playground" where we enjoy regrettable, cheap entertainments.

I think the instant gratification monkey knows we're onto its nefarious ways, so it has developed something new: **dark productivity**.

This is the most insidious form of instant gratification.  You _think_ you're getting stuff done, but all you're really doing is shuffling cheap things around looking busy and avoiding what really matters.
