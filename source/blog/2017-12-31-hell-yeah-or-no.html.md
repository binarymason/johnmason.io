Derek Sivers recommends in this [1 minute youtube video](https://youtu.be/1ehWlVeMrqw) to do things that are _Hell Yeah_ and say no to everything else.

John Paul DeJoria, multi billionaire and co-founder of Paul Mitchell hair products, recommends to "Pay attention to the vital few and ignore the trivial many".

Warren Buffett advises, "The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything."
