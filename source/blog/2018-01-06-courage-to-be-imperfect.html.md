According to [Alfred Adler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Adler), everyone has an innate desire to achieve mastery and superiority. Ironically, the only way to achieve mastery is admit inferiority and learn from mistakes.

It is up to us to determine what mistakes mean to us. They can either be a failure or a stepping stone to success. Hence one of Adler's best pieces of advice:

Have the courage to be imperfect.
